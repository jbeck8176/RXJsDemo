<h1>RXJs ALL THINGS!</h1>
<h2>(Just kidding please don't do that)</h2>
<p>This app will be taking a look at RxJS through the eyes of TypeScript and Angular 2. We'll cover some doâ€™s and don'ts of RxJS including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Switching from promises to observables.
    </li>
    <li>Browser side cashing and multiple components data sharing with subjects.</li>
    <li>Work on taming element events.</li>
    <li>And, round it out with a few unit tests just for fun!</li>
</ul>
